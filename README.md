## Things to know

The Rails API fetches 'player' data from BallDontLie API when the database is initally seeded.

There are some players missing from the API due to many factors, injury, free agency or just missing. So if your favorite player is missing that could possibly be the reason.

There is a migration for 'Leaderboards' the framework is established but full intergration is still a work in progress.
